        <h3>WEB DEVELOPMENT AS AN INDUSTRY</h3>
        <p>
          Examples of dramatic transformation in communication and commerce led
          by web development include e-commerce. Online auction site such as
          eBay have changed the way consumers find and purchase goods and
          services. Online retailers such as Amazon.com and Buy.com (among many
          others) have transformed the shopping and bargain-hunting experience
          for many consumers.

        <h1>PRACTICAL WEB DEVELOPMENT</h1>
        <p>
          We have written a lot about the skills you need as a web developer,
          but this article is more about challenging yourself and trying to
          build a project with the help of all the tasks we prepared.<br /><br />
          We know how vital practical experience is, so you need to do this in a
          practical way, and learn web development with coding. There are a lot
          of challenges listed here, and I assume that a lot of you will need a
          few months to gather all the knowledge, write all the code and
          basically complete everything to make all the things from our
          challenge work. In fact, I suggest you pace yourself and go step by
          step. If you feel like it, your are free to make some of the
          challenges easier, but revisit them later to see if you have improved.
          <br /><br />Skills you need to complete the challenges get more and
          more difficult with each step so that you can build your knowledge
          gradually. We are really glad about any feedback, so let us know how
          you managed to solve our challenges (hey@codebrainer.com)or if you
          have any ideas on how to make them more interesting or
          straightforward. Not to mention, you are also helping fellow
          colleagues with any kind of feedback you can provide.
